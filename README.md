# Welcome to tri!

## A triangulated memory gallery.

Adding a new frame to the gallery is simple - check out the instructions in `index.js`. It's as simple as adding a frame object like the following (along with the appropriate image files):
```
const bolivia = {
  id: 'bolivia',
  sources: [
    { src: 'bolivia.gif' },
    { src: 'bolivia_1.png' },
    { src: 'bolivia_2.png' },
    // add as many images (or gifs) to a frame as you like! they will cycle through as you click.
  ],
  maxWidth: DEFAULT_LANDSCAPE_WIDTH
}
```

*For best results, make sure all images within a frame have the same dimensions.*
